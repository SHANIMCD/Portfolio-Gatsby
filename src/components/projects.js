      Based on our knowledge of APIâ€™s our task was to use a public API (or more if we preferred) of our choice and create a front end way of displaying them. 
      Our project was a one-page app where we pulled in events from an events API and rendered them on a map. 
      My role: finding the API, creating the get request and rendering the keys needed to the dropdown menu.

    <p className="project-comment">Create a full-stack app with multiple components which can include external APIs or be created ourselves, following the MVC model with react. 
    We were only given a readme file so had to start from the beginning for the first time.
    My role: I worked more with the models, and how they are controlled which led into the seeding of the profiles since I knew the most about which fields of input would be required etc. 
    Also, I did styling on the front page and rendered the only external API that we used on the page.

    A web app that displays gyms specialising in a particular discipline. 
    My three disciplines were Bodybuilding, Pilates and CrossFit. 
    I used the framework Django for creation of the models, serializers and managing the back end and used ReactJs for the front end.
