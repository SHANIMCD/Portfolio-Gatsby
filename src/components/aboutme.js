      About
      </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
      I am a developer with an ongoing desire to explore as much code as my brain will allow, rest, then repeat.
      <br />
      Before my career change into software engineering, I worked as an Office Manager & EA in a FinTech start up.
      Building a good working relationship with the developer and DevOps team there inspired me to begin the journey into tech.
      <br />
      Below are the projects that I have been working on which can be found on GitHub
