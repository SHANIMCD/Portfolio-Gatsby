    <p>Hi!
      <br /> 
      Welcome to my corner of the internet!
      I am a Junior Developer with an ongoing desire to explore as much code as my brain will allow, rest, then repeat.
      <br />
      Have a look at what I have been working on. 
      If you have any questions, please see my email to the left :)
      Enjoy!
    </p>
